<h1>Activity Logger REST API</h1>

<p><small>Last updated: February 2013</small></p>

<p><small>Version: 0.20<br>
Common unfiltered GET interface to data in the REST service is ready.
REST API URLs now require HTTP basic authentication and SSL (HTTPS). This index page is open to all. 
In addition to the server HTTP authentication, the code demonstrates both a security role and a user name specific access controls
(the former is preferred). Private data is accessed by using (a secret) device name hash.
Request parameters can now be now parsed but not used except for devices URLs.
Example and test request URLs have been added.
POST methods include only adding raw data and a new user routine.
</small></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the description for REST service for
mobile device users. It is used for storing and retrieving user
activity, application use and location routine records.</p>
<p>The server runs on Apache Tomcat and uses PostgreSQL database
for storing data. The HTTP REST interface is implemented using the
Jersey libraries.</p>
<p>Supported request formats are XML, visual XML for browsers and
JSON. The first and the last format is meant for application use, the
browser XML format for human access via a web browser.</p>

<h2>Security model</h2>

<h3>Access rights:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Main page is open to all (communication mode HTTP/HTTPS).</li>
 <li>All REST services are protected with HTTPS (SSL) using a developer (self-signed) certificate.</li>
 <li>All REST services requite an HTTP Basic authentication. There are two groups: administrators and users.</li>
 <li>Administrators can access all services without using device_name parameter.</li>
 <li>Users need to add a query parameter <i>device_name</i> to all sensitive (user specific) data queries and all POST queries.</li>
 <li><i>device_name</i> identifies a specific mobile device (and thus user) in the database. It is used as a password for your own data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Intended handling of creating a new user:</h3>
<ul>
 <!-- Too complex to set up:
 <li>Request your <i>device_name</i> to be added to the database by an administrator. Contact information will be provided...</li>
 <li>Administrator will POST the new device information to the database and provide the user with the user credentials for HTTP Basic authentication.</li>
 -->
 <li>
  Request your user credentials for the HTTP Basic authentication of the service from its administrator.
 </li>
 <li>Add your device to the database by making a POST request with correct JSON data to the devices URL.</li>
 <li>Verify that your device is found by GET query to URL .../devices/<i>device_name</i>.</li>
 <li>After that, use other REST services (GET/POST) with the query parameter <samp>...?device_name=<i>device_name</i></samp> after URL.</li>
 <li>
  A new user should POST any new location (routine_type_id=0), application use (routine_type_id=1) or named routine classes (routine_type_id=2) to the
  routine_classes URL. They are also added automatically as needed when POSTing user routines.
 </li>
 <li>A new user could also POST his own logger_application_name to logger_applications URL but it is also added implicitly, if needed.</li>
 <li>User can add two kinds of routine data to the service:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
 <li>Raw measurements (location and application use at a certain time).</li>
 <li>
  User routines consisting of either location, application use or (automatically and algorithmically recognized) named combination routines,
  taking place during some time period.
 </li>
</ol>
 <p>
  Final note: The service will accept also POSTing user routine items without prior registration of device_name, logger_application_name,
  routine_class_name or routine_class_id, if such fields are defined in the posted user routine. The necessary records will be created automatically
  into the database, as needed, using some default values for missing parameters.
 </p>

<h2>REST URLs by the method</h2>

<p>The URL starts with the HTTP scheme and resource address, for
example <samp>http://localhost:8080/</samp> or <samp>https://&lt;your server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/</samp></p>

<h3>POST</h3>

<p>
 Recommended testing is to be done using Firefox Poster plugin at this time (no test form is provided). Remember to fill in the User Auth fields.
 Because of forced HTTPS the testing on localhost URLs may fail the HTTP connection authentication.
</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href="rest/user_routines/test"><samp>/ActivityLogger/rest/user_routines/test</samp></a></dt>
<dd>
 POST a new user routine to the database temporarily and return all user routines with the new routine added. Then undo the storing operation.
 <p>
 Correct test JSON content example is given below. Values in <i>italics</i> are ignored in POST requests as they are created by the database upon
 insertion. They can thus be omitted from the JSON. Also undefined fields can be omitted, resulting in <i>null</i> or 0 default values. GSON library
 also allows to insert extra fields into the JSON object but they will not be parsed and bound into the target object.
 </p>
 <pre>

 <i>"userRoutinesId":"6",</i>

 <p>
  Expected return values are HTTP status codes "200 OK" (with the JSON/XML list of user routines),
  "422 Unprocessable Entity" for bad JSON or "500 Internal Server Error" for bad data values.
  Other error codes may also appear as documented at the end of this page...
 </p>
 <p>
  This POST does not use any query parameters as the <i>device_name</i> is embedded into the data anyway. Also, this URL is meant for the
  administrator to use in testing.
 </p>
 <p>
  This method is now left unfinished. It just adds <i>testInsertUserRoutine device name</i> to the devices table and returns that record for further
  processing into the user routines list (which obviously fails and makes the server return HTTP 500 Internal Server Error for the POST request).
 </p>
</dd>

<dt><a href="rest/user_routines"><samp>/ActivityLogger/rest/user_routines</samp></a></dt>
<dd>
 POST a new user routine to the database. Saves the device name if it does not exist in the database (using current time, "plat" for platform and
 244 (Finland) for mcc values), the logger application if not present, raw measurement, routine class if not present, list of
 applications (application entry created if an entry with the same name and package class name does not already exist) and user routine entries
 binding all these values together. One or more user routine bindings in the DB form one user routine entry on user routine requests.
 <p>
 Correct JSON content example is given below. Values in <i>italics</i> are ignored in POST requests as they are created by the database upon insertion.
 They can thus be omitted from the JSON. Also undefined fields can be omitted, resulting in <i>null</i> or 0 default values. GSON library also allows
 to insert extra fields into the JSON object but they will not be parsed and bound into the target object.
 </p>
 <p>
  Null (undefined) values for different fields are defined as follows:<br>
  String missing or empty.<br>
  GPS co-ordinate value -1000.<br>
  routineTypeId 0 (= location routine, 1 = application routine and 2 = user defined routine)<br>
  Cell ID -1.<br>
  Application list empty or missing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Referenced raw measurement record gets automatically the timestamp of the insertion time.
  It is likely outside the routine period (start time - end time) but time of the raw measurement is not meant to be used in the context of user routine
  properties.

  Expected return values are HTTP status codes "201 Created" (with the Location header containing the URL of the new resource),
  "422 Unprocessable Entity" for bad JSON or "500 Internal Server Error" for bad data values (test 500 by using the text "test error" as the POSTed
  content). Other error codes may also appear as documented at the end of this page...
 </p>
 <p>
  This POST does not need any query parameters as the <i>device_name</i> is embedded into the data anyway. Also, it is not possible to access (other)
  user's data by POSTing data.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do not set the Accept header in the request to "application/json" since the request may only return "text/plain" on some errors.
  Value ""application/json, text/plain" is generally safe on clients for both GET and POST, as is not specifying the Accept header for any POST.
  Incorrect Accept header on request will produce the "406 Not Acceptable" HTTP error response.

<p>Updating existing data is not possible for now.</p>
<h3>DELETE</h3>
<p>Deleting existing data is not possible for now.</p>

<h2>HTTP response codes for GET and POST (PUT and DELETE are not supported on the service but OPTIONS and HEAD are automatically)</h2>
<p>Not all message types have been implemented by the service. The response is also URL (resource) specific.</p>
<!-- The tabbing inside pre does not align the same way in this file as in the browser... -->
<pre>
200 OK				Regular response to GET requests. Also provides some content to display as described by the Content Type header.
201 Created			POST: Return URL of the created resource in the Location header.
204 No Content			The message after a successful DELETE request. No DELETE methods have been implemented, though.

400 Bad Request			The request cannot be fulfilled due to bad syntax. More related to the HTTP protocol itself than REST.
401 Unauthorized		Missing or wrong HTTP authentication. The service should force HTTP to HTTPS when using the REST API.
403 Forbidden			An autenticated user has insuffiecient rights to use the resource. Administrators should not see this.
404 Not Found			URL or resource by the id is not found. When using query parameters the response is an empty set if matches were not found.
405 Method Not Allowed		POST, PUT and DELETE request were made to wrong URLs (returns available methods in the Allow header).
406 Not Acceptable		The HTTP requests ahould have application/json, text/html, text/xml or text/plain in their Accept headers (or nothing).
415 Unsupported Media Type	POST request did not contain JSON as a payload. Not yet implemented.
422 Unprocessable Entity	POST request did not contain valid JSON as a payload.

500 Internal Server Error	Server or database error. Check query parameters for correct format (e.g. use ISO 8601 timestamps).
501 Not Implemented		Response to PUT ja DELETE, OPTIONS and HEAD requests (ActivityLogger does not support those methods). Not yet implemented.
503 Service Unavailable		The server is under much load or other temporary problem (try again later). Not yet implemented.

<h2>Todos and known problems:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Query parameters and security only work for devices URLs.</li>
<li>
 Firefox Poster plugin does not work with HTTPS localhost URLs. The response jams after the headers have been loaded. To test locally, set
 <i>transport guarantee</i> element to NONE instead of CONFIDENTAL in the web.xml configuration file of the application. CURRENTLY SET TO NONE.
